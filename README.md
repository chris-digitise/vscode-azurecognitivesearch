# Azure Cognitive Search for Visual Studio Code (Preview)

[![Build Status](https://delegenz.visualstudio.com/vs-code-pipelines/_apis/build/status/microsoft.vscode-azurecognitivesearch?branchName=master)](https://delegenz.visualstudio.com/vs-code-pipelines/_build/latest?definitionId=6&branchName=master)

[Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) is a search-as-a-service cloud solution that gives developers APIs and tools for adding a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications.

This Visual Studio Code extension makes it easy to manage your search service with the full capabilities of the REST APIs while providing rich IntelliSense and snippets to make it easier to take advantage of the full range of capabilities. With the extension, you can create and update indexes and other components, add documents, search, and more. Check out the gifs and images below to see the extension in action.

You can learn more about the extension in this [blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/accelerate-search-index-development-with-visual-studio-code/ba-p/2120941). You can also learn how to get up and running with Azure Cognitive Search in this [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-vs-code). 

## Features

### Browse all your Azure Cognitive Search services

Get access to all your search services in one place. You can quickly see all your indexes, indexers, and other components.

### Create new indexes, indexers, data sources, skillsets and synonym maps

You can create a new index or other component just by editing the JSON and saving the file. You can then read, update, or delete these components at any time.

### Take advantage of rich IntelliSense

The extension also includes IntelliSense to guide you as you’re building out your JSON. Instead of referencing external docs each time, you can see what parameters exist and what their allowed values are as you type.

In addition to IntelliSense, the extension provides snippets or templates for building more complex objects, such as data sources and skillsets, so that you have a good starting point.

### Edit or delete indexes, indexers, data sources, skillsets and synonym maps

### Add or update documents in the search index

Adding or updating documents is something that’s not possible in the portal today. With the extension, you can quickly add a document, and it will even save you some time by creating a JSON template for you based on your index definition.

You can view or update existing documents too.

### Query your search indexes

Once you’ve added documents to your search service, you can also query from within the extension and view the results side by side. You can even add multiple queries or save the queries to a file to refer to them later.
